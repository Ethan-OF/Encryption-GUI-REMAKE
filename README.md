# Encryption GUI REMAKE
 This is a recreation of my old Encryption software that I have been using for years to encrypt messages. It's not meant for any real use other than my own personal satisfaction.


## ANY EDITS:

 This project is built using QT6 (6.5.2), and QT Creator. I've had issues with the QML imports, if anyone tries to modify the QML code, errors resembling a missing Library or DLL, or incompatible version, make sure the imported version is correct. In my case QT would set the version to 5.15, and I had to change it myself to 6.4.

### LIBRARIES:

This project should always be packed with the correct QT DLL files and requirements. If any are missing, I'll resort to blaming it on different setups, and likely won't be providing any support for fixes.

## HOW TO USE:

#### OPTIONAL: Change the key on the bottom left to anything you want to make your encrypted text unique
1. Text goes in the right
2. Change the mode with the mode button
3. Press the button
